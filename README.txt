Background

This is an emplementation of ray-casting volume render for VTK (www.vtk.org), with extension to Slicer (www.slicer.org).  The VTK classws were developed at the Robarts Research Institution by John H. Baxter under the supervision of Elvis C.S. chen.  It works as a drop-in replacement for vtkVolumeMapper.

Julien Finet wrote the Slicer extension in the summer of 2012 during the Slicer Workshop at Boston after meeting with Elvis Chen.
